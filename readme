Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Prediction Model – AI-Based Health Risk Analyzer
Identify kidney disease risks early with this powerful Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction Model, crafted using advanced machine learning techniques. This two-part project—spanning training and testing notebooks—offers a complete pipeline for building and validating a diagnostic tool that predicts the presence of chronic kidney disease using real medical data.

Developed in Python with Jupyter Notebooks, the project is ideal for developers, researchers, and healthcare analysts seeking an intelligent, ready-to-use health prediction model.

What’s Included:

Training Notebook:

Data cleaning & preprocessing

Feature engineering based on medical indicators (e.g., blood pressure, albumin, hemoglobin, serum creatinine, and more)

Model building with classification algorithms

Accuracy metrics and performance evaluation

 Testing Notebook:

Real-time prediction testing using new inputs

User-interactive fields for entering medical test values

Instant result output (CKD detected or not)

Key Features:

1) Supports multiple ML models (like Decision Trees, SVM, etc.)

 2) Clearly visualized data distributions and model results

 3)Fully customizable and beginner-friendly Python code

 4)Designed for early diagnosis support and educational demos
